# CHANGELOG

## v3.2.0 — 2026-04-23 — Production-ready wellness vertical

The first production-cut of the wellness vertical. Built for **Enhanced Wellness** (Dr. Haror's Ranchi franchise, owner Rishu) but designed as a tenant configuration on the existing multi-tenant CRM — not a fork.

### Added

**Vertical foundation (v3.1)**
- Multi-tenant `Tenant.vertical` field (`generic` / `wellness`) drives sidebar, theme, and landing route
- 9 new Prisma models: `Patient`, `Visit`, `Prescription`, `ConsentForm`, `TreatmentPlan`, `Service`, `ServiceConsumption`, `AgentRecommendation`, `Location`
- `User.wellnessRole` (doctor / professional / telecaller / helper) — orthogonal to the existing RBAC role
- 106-service catalog mirroring drharorswellness.com (hair transplant, aesthetics, body contouring, etc.)
- Per-service `targetRadiusKm` for marketing geo-targeting
- Multi-location ready (Ranchi seeded; franchise-ready)

**Wellness-specific UI (v3.1)**
- Owner Dashboard with KPI tiles, 30-day revenue chart, location switcher
- Recommendations inbox (AI agent cards with Approve/Reject)
- Patients list + detail with 8 tabs: case history, prescription pad, consent canvas, treatment plans, log visit, photos, inventory, telehealth
- Service catalog with inline edit + Packages tab calculator
- Day-grid Calendar by doctor
- 4-tab Reports (P&L by Service / Per-Pro / Per-Location / Marketing Attribution)
- Locations admin
- Telecaller queue with SLA timer + 6 disposition codes + 30s auto-refresh
- Patient Portal (phone + SMS OTP login, view visits/Rx/treatment plan, download PDFs)
- Public booking page at `/book/:slug` (3-step, no auth)
- Embeddable lead-capture widget (`/embed/widget.js` + `/embed/lead-form.html`)
- Per-location side-by-side comparison dashboard

**Backend automations (v3.1+v3.2)**
- Real **orchestrator engine** — daily 07:00 IST cron, reads dashboard context, generates 1-3 prioritised recommendation cards via Gemini (rules-based fallback), action dispatcher fires on Approve
- **Junk-lead filter** with rules + optional Gemini fallback for ambiguous mid-band leads
- **Lead auto-router** — keyword → service category → assigned specialist (doctor/professional/telecaller round-robin)
- **Appointment SMS reminders** cron (15 min, T-24h + T-1h)
- **Wellness ops** cron (hourly NPS post-visit + 90-day junk retention)
- **Low-stock inventory alerts** cron (daily 09:00 IST, email + in-app to managers)
- **Waitlist auto-fill** on cancellation (offers slot to next waitlisted patient via SMS)
- **Deep retention enforcement** — anonymise inactive 24mo+ patients, hard-delete consent forms >7yr (DPDP), purge old call logs

**External Partner API (v3.1)**
- `/api/v1/external/*` — API-key authenticated endpoints for sister Globussoft products (Callified.ai voice/WhatsApp, AdsGPT for ad creation, Globus Phone for softphone)
- 12 endpoints: leads (POST + GET poll), calls (POST + PATCH), messages, appointments, contacts/lookup, patients/lookup, services, staff, locations, /me, /health
- Two demo keys auto-seeded
- Junk filter + auto-router run inline on POST /leads

**Compliance & security (v3.2)**
- AES-256-GCM **field encryption** on patient PII (`Patient.allergies`, `Visit.notes`, `Prescription.*`, `ConsentForm.signatureSvg`); transparent decrypt-on-read via Prisma extension; opt-in via `WELLNESS_FIELD_KEY` env var
- One-shot `scripts/encrypt-existing-pii.js` for backfilling pre-encryption rows
- Wellness retention enforcement (DPDP-aligned)

**Telehealth (v3.2)**
- Jitsi-based video consult tab on Patient Detail, room name auto-stored on `Visit.videoRoom`

**White-label branding (v3.2)**
- `Tenant.logoUrl` + `Tenant.brandColor` — uploadable via Settings → Branding
- Logo + accent applied to Sidebar header, owner dashboard, email templates, invoice PDFs

**Loyalty + referrals (v3.2)**
- `LoyaltyTransaction` + `Referral` models, manager UI at `/wellness/loyalty`
- Auto-link referrals when referred patient signs up via `source = "referral"`

**Currency**
- Tenant-driven currency: `Tenant.country`, `Tenant.defaultCurrency`, `Tenant.locale` feed a single `formatMoney()` helper
- Indian tenants see ₹ with Lakh / Crore notation; US sees $; full BCP-47 fallback otherwise
- India-aware Pricing page (timezone-detected)

**Documentation**
- `docs/wellness-client/PRD.md` — product requirements
- `docs/wellness-client/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — phased build plan
- `docs/wellness-client/STATUS.md` — current build state + demo walkthrough
- `docs/wellness-client/EXTERNAL_API.md` — partner API reference
- `docs/wellness-client/EMBED_WIDGET.md` — website integration guide
- `docs/wellness-client/RISHU_TODOS.md` — items waiting on the client
- `PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md` — onboarding + ops procedures (this release)

### Test coverage

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend vitest (component + utility) | 28 | passing |
| E2E `wellness.spec.js` (route + page coverage) | 103 | passing |
| E2E `wellness-deep.spec.js` (PDF, cron, dispatcher, encryption, photos) | 28 | passing |
| E2E `wellness-ui-flows.spec.js` (real browser interactions) | 8 | passing |
| E2E `wellness-auth-edge.spec.js` (token/concurrent/error shape) | 9 | passing |
| E2E `wellness-a11y.spec.js` (axe-core, zero serious/critical) | 6 | passing |
| E2E `wellness-integration.spec.js` (race + webhook + AI gate) | 16 | passing |
| Cross-browser projects | Chromium + Firefox + WebKit + mobile-chrome | configured |
| Total | **520+ E2E + 28 vitest** | |

### Bug fixes (this release)

- `GET /wellness/patients/abc` → 500 → now 400 (numeric ID validation via router.param)
- Malformed JSON body → HTML error → now 400 JSON (global error handler)
- Wellness sidebar text was illegible (dark on dark) — scoped CSS variable override inside `aside.glass`
- Icon-only buttons missing accessible names (Logout, NotificationBell, Softphone, OwnerDashboard switcher) → aria-label
- Embed form inputs not associated with labels → `id` + `for` + autocomplete hints
- USD `$` leakage in generic Reports + AgentReports → `formatMoney()` everywhere
- `Survey.title` Prisma error in NPS engine → now `Survey.name` (model has no `title`)
- Color contrast on wellness theme — `--text-secondary` darkened from `#7A6E66` (3.8:1) to `#5C5046` (>7:1, passes WCAG AAA)

### Removed from wellness sidebar (don't apply to clinics)

`Pipeline`, `Deal Insights`, `Tickets`, `CPQ`, `Live Chat`, `Chatbots`, `Voice/SMS/WhatsApp config` (those live in Callified), `Booking Pages` (replaced by `/book/:slug`), `E-Signatures` (replaced by per-patient consent canvas), `Lead Scoring` (replaced by junk filter `aiScore`), `Web Visitors`, `Generic Reports / Forecasting / Funnel / Staff Reports`, `Expenses` (per Rishu's feedback)

### Deferred (not in v3.2)

- AdsGPT silent SSO + back-link → with AdsGPT team
- Callified silent SSO + back-link + lead webhook → with Callified team
- Superphone + Zylu CSV migration → waiting on client exports
- Android app Play Store resubmit → waiting on client docs
- Performance / load testing
- Hindi i18n
- Real provider integration tests (sandboxes)
